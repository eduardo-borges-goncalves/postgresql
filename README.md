# My PostgreSQL Studies

## Introduction
This repository contains my notes and exercises from my studies on PostgreSQL, a popular open-source relational database management system. 
In this document, I will summarize some of the key concepts I have learned and provide examples of exercises that helped me to practice my skills.

## Getting Started
To start working with PostgreSQL, I installed the `psql` command-line interface and created a database using the `createdb` command.
database using the `psql` command and ran basic SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` to create tables and manipulate data.

## Exercises
To practice my PostgreSQL skills, I worked through a series of exercises that included:

- Creating tables and inserting data
- Querying data using basic `SELECT` statements
- Using the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on conditions
- Joining two or more tables using the `JOIN` keyword
- Using aggregate functions such as `SUM` and `COUNT` to summarize data
- Using `subqueries` to retrieve data based on the results of another query
- Creating `views` to simplify complex queries
- Using `transactions` to group multiple SQL statements into a single operation
- Using `foreign keys` and `indexes` to enforce referential integrity and improve performance
- Alter column, Alter table, Set type to column
- How to work with `DATES`, like retrieve orders from a especific time

## Conclusion
My studies on PostgreSQL have given me a solid foundation in working with relational databases, and I feel confident in my ability to create and manipulate tables, query data, and perform more advanced operations such as joins and aggregates. I plan to continue practicing my skills by working on more complex exercises and exploring the many features and capabilities of PostgreSQL.
